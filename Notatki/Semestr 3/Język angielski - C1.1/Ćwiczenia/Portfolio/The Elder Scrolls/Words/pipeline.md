Definition:
A pipeline is a series of interconnected processes or steps that are used to transform raw data into a final product.

Pipelines are commonly used in software development, industrial processes, and data processing.

They are a way to automate tasks and ensure that data is processed in a consistent and efficient manner.

Pipelines are typically made up of a series of stages, each of which performs a specific task.

The data is passed from one stage to the next, and at each stage, it is transformed in some way.

The final stage of the pipeline produces the desired output.

Pipelines can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, such as:

- **Data cleaning**
- **Data transformation**
- **Data analysis**
- **Data visualization**
- **Code generation**
- **Model training**
- **Model deployment**

Pipelines are a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks and improve efficiency.

They are a key part of many software development workflows, and they are increasingly being used in other fields as well.

Here is a table that summarizes the key characteristics of pipelines:
