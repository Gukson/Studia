Definition:
A tangent plane is a plane that touches a surface at a single point. It is the best approximation to the surface near that point.

Tangent planes are used to study the behavior of surfaces near a specific point. They can also be used to approximate the surface over a small area.

Here is a table that summarizes the key characteristics of tangent planes:

|Feature|Description|

|**Touches a surface at a single point**|A tangent plane touches a surface at a single point.|
|**Best approximation to the surface near that point**|A tangent plane is the best approximation to the surface near that point.|
|**Used to study the behavior of surfaces**|Tangent planes are used to study the behavior of surfaces near a specific point.|
|**Approximate the surface over a small area**|Tangent planes can also be used to approximate the surface over a small area.|

Tangent planes are a fundamental concept in differential geometry and have applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics.

Here are some examples of how tangent planes are used:

- **Physics:** Tangent planes are used to model the behavior of objects near a specific point.
- **Engineering:** Tangent planes are used to design structures that are strong and stable.
- **Computer graphics:** Tangent planes are used to render 3D graphics with smooth surfaces.
