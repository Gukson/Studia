Volumetric scanning, also known as 3D scanning, is a process of creating a three-dimensional representation of an object or scene. It involves capturing data from multiple viewpoints and then using that data to create a 3D model.

Here is a table that summarizes the key characteristics of volumetric scanning:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Creating 3D representations** |Volumetric scanning creates 3D representations of objects or scenes.|
|**Capturing data from multiple viewpoints** |Volumetric scanning captures data from multiple viewpoints to create a complete 3D representation.|
|**Using data to create 3D models** |The captured data is used to create a 3D model that represents the object or scene.|
|**Wide range of applications** |Volumetric scanning has a wide range of applications in various fields, including manufacturing, engineering, medicine, and archaeology.|

Volumetric scanning is a powerful tool that can be used to capture complex objects and scenes with great detail. It is particularly useful when creating physical replicas of objects, designing and testing products, and preserving historical artifacts.

Here is an example of how volumetric scanning is used in manufacturing:

A manufacturing engineer might use volumetric scanning to create a 3D model of a new product prototype. The model can then be used to analyze the product's design and identify potential problems that could affect its performance.
