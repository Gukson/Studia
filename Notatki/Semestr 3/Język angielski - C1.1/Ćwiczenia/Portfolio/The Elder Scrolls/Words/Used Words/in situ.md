Translation: **In situ** (łac. _w miejscu_)
Definition:
**In situ** (Latin for "in place") is a term used to describe any study, measurement, or other operation performed directly in the environment where the object or process being studied is located. In other words, in situ studies are conducted in the natural environment, without the need to move the object or process to a laboratory.

The significance of the term "in situ" is particularly important in fields such as:

- **Biology**, where in situ studies are used to study organisms living in their natural environment;
- **Geology**, where in situ studies are used to study geological structures and processes taking place in the rock;
- **Archaeology**, where in situ studies are used to study archaeological sites and artifacts;
- **Engineering**, where in situ studies are used to study the structural condition of buildings and infrastructure.

An illustration of an in situ study technique is the method of measuring soil salinity. For this purpose, a measuring probe is placed directly into the soil and then the salinity value is read. Another example of an in situ study technique is the method of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), which allows for the analysis of the chemical composition of an object or process without the need to destroy it.

Conducting in situ studies has many advantages compared to laboratory studies. First, in situ studies are much more representative of the actual environment in which the object or process being studied is located. Additionally, in situ studies are often less expensive and more environmentally friendly than laboratory studies.

However, in situ studies can also pose certain challenges. For example, in situ studies can be time-consuming and difficult to conduct in the case of hard-to-reach areas. Additionally, in situ studies can be susceptible to interference from external factors such as weather or the movement of objects.

In summary, in situ studies are a valuable scientific tool that allows for the study of objects and processes in their natural environment. In situ studies are often more representative, less expensive, and more environmentally friendly than laboratory studies. However, in situ studies can be time-consuming and difficult to conduct, as well as susceptible to interference from external factors.
