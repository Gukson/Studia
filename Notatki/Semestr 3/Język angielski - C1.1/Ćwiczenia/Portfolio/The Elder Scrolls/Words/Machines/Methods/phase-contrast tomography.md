Definition:
Phase-contrast tomography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses the phase shift of light to create three-dimensional images of objects. It is a relatively new technique that has been developed in recent years.

Here is a table that summarizes the key characteristics of phase-contrast tomography:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Non-invasive imaging technique**|Phase-contrast tomography is a non-invasive imaging technique that does not require the use of ionizing radiation.|
|**Uses phase shift of light**|Phase-contrast tomography uses the phase shift of light to create three-dimensional images of objects.|
|**Three-dimensional images**|Phase-contrast tomography creates three-dimensional images of objects.|
|**Relatively new technique**|Phase-contrast tomography is a relatively new technique that has been developed in recent years.|
|**Wide range of applications**|Phase-contrast tomography has a wide range of applications in various fields, including medicine, biology, and materials science.|

Phase-contrast tomography is a powerful tool that can be used to image objects with high resolution without damaging them. It is particularly useful for imaging soft tissues and biological samples.

Here is an example of how phase-contrast tomography is used in medicine:

A medical doctor might use phase-contrast tomography to image a patient's heart. The images can be used to diagnose heart disease and to track the progress of treatment.
