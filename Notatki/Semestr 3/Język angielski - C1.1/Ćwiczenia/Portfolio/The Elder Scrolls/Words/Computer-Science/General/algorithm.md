Translation: **Algorytm**
Definition: 
An algorithm is a sequence of steps that are followed to solve a problem or complete a task.

Algorithms can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, from simple mathematical calculations to complex scientific simulations.

They can also be used to automate tasks, such as data processing and file management.

Algorithms are typically written in a programming language, but they can also be expressed in other forms, such as natural language or flowcharts.

Here are some of the key characteristics of algorithms:

- **Definiteness:** An algorithm should always produce the same output for a given input.
    
- **Effectiveness:** An algorithm should be able to solve the problem in a finite amount of time.
    
- **Efficiency:** An algorithm should be able to solve the problem using as few resources as possible.
    
- **Generality:** An algorithm should be able to solve a wide variety of problems.
    

Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and are used in a wide variety of applications.

They are a powerful tool that can be used to solve complex problems and automate tasks.

They are also a valuable tool for learning about how computers work and how to program them.
