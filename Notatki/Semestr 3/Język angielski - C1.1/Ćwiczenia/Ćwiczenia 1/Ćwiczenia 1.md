# Gamification
## [The Future of Creativity and Innovation is Gamification: Gabe Zichermann at TEDxVilnius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZvRw71Slew)
good morning everybody I'm Gabe Zimmerman and I want to start off by introducing you since we've been talking about so many extraordinary young kids I want to introduce you to a perfectly ordinary young boy his name is Griffin Sanders and he's a ten year old kid and last summer Griffin like so many other perfectly normal ten year old kids went out for Drive with his 74 year old great-grandmother and four-year-old brother in the suburbs of Denver and they were on the freeway on the highway they were out he was super excited about you know maybe going to get an ice-cream or buying a new toy and as their car got up to about a hundred kilometers an hour on the highway Griffin's great-grandmother had a heart attack and passed out behind the wheel and after quickly trying to revive his great-grandmother as their vehicle slowly slid into oncoming traffic Griffin did what of course any perfectly normal ten-year-old kid would do he grabbed control of the car and safely executed a maneuver where he put the car through oncoming traffic into the side of the road saving the lives of his great-grandmother his four-year-old brother and all the other drivers on the road and the police turned to Griffin this perfectly normal ten-year-old kid and said how did you do this and he said mariokart with the answer and he thought it was actually like a test from inside the game and this is amazing right we're looking at this unbelievable kind of new creativity this new innovative view of the world if we took a step back and went back to sort of the beginning of civilization and we asked what is creativity our view of creativity was always so grounded this idea that people who are creative were highly intelligent and probably quite privileged right they had access to things that other people didn't and as time moved on we started to see the creative person is also being a little bit crazy and measuring the quality of their creativity not only by the things that they produce but also by the quantity of things that they produced so a sort of prolific nature was meaningful and important as we entered the Industrial Revolution we also start to see the creative person as having a unique methodology and I think this as well with the idea of industrialization that it wasn't just the output but the process that makes a creative person interesting and towards the latter half of that time period we also started to do things like count the economic value of the creativity that people produced the more that it was worth the more creative and more interesting the person would be and that also being good at creativity and innovation meant beating other people but I would posit that we've entered a new era of creativity and innovation we've turned some corner we're in a new period of time and in this new period of time let's be honest all the easy problems have been solved if we are to take society from where it is now to where it needs to go it to be creative and innovative we've got to think about creativity through a different prism it needs to be social it needs to be something that amplifies each one of us individually but it also needs to be democratic because the next great ideas won't just come from the privileged few from the crazy from the people with methodology they will come from each and every one of us and collectively transform the world that we live in this is also combined with an idea called fluid intelligence which is the thing that Griffin was demonstrating it's our ability to come up with new ideas on-the-fly to think our way out of problems to be innovative in the moment these two things these ideas put together I think are being driven largely being expressed powerfully through the concept of games and it's not just games like Minecraft that forty million kids are so are playing I'm sure some of you or some of your children actually play but it's the broader context because it's not just what they're playing it's also how much they're playing and what that play does to their brains so one of the reasons why games are so powerful why they have such an effect on us is a concept called intrinsic reinforcement and here's how it works anytime you challenge yourself to something anything at all it doesn't matter how big or how small and then you achieve that thing your brain secretes a magical little bit of dopamine which is a pleasurable chemical feels really good right so challenge achievement that feels good now it turns out that a researcher a neuropsychologist named Ian Robertson is also coined this concept called the winner effect so the more you do this challenge achievement pleasure loop the more dopamine and testosterone is secreted in your brain the more you want to do it so the more you succeed the more you want to succeed and that dopamine testosterone changes the way our brains are actually structured so people who go through these gaming experiences doing this challenge achievement loop over and over again want to do that more and more but it's also a design principle of game concepts that enables them to be so transformative it's what I like to call the three FS feedback friends and fun a system that has that powerful winner effect but also has feedback friends and fun is one that's going to be quite compelling so I feel like we've entered this new era as I mentioned to you which i think is actually pretty revolutionary it's not just the kinds of creative ideas that we're creating it's the quantity of creative ideas it's the quality of those creative ideas and it's the number of people who get to be creative and whose voices in that prism of creativity get amplified if we want to do that deliberately if we want to take advantage of the power of games some of my contemporaries suggest that that will just naturally evolve from people playing Mario Kart and I think that's the exception rather than the rule I think what we need to do is collectively decide to actively make that happen to put the power of games to work to inspire creativity and innovation and that concept is called gamification that's when we take deliberately the ideas of games and apply them to changing people's behavior making the world a more interesting more dynamic and more creative place now there's some great examples of this happening for example the game aterna so in the game eterna hundreds of thousand people play this game is kind of amazing it's all about people discovering new structures in RNA which is a core building Rock of the world right a core a protein in the world individual people average people have discovered literally thousands of new RNA structures that science has never discovered so scientists have never been able to find these and players in the game RNA have complete new biomechanical structures from playing this game or Philo which is a game from my home country from Canada that players can play and it's a game in which you uncover the structure of DNA so you're looking at the core components of DNA players of Philo have discovered approximately 350,000 potential mistakes in our understanding of the structure of DNA so these are potential mistakes that scientists have made about how DNA works and what it is and what what's on every aspect of DNA and players have discovered this but it's not just the realm of science it's also in the realm of Commerce and consumerism companies like quirky which some of you might know are using game concepts to radically transform the way that they do innovation that they do new product development this is a consumer products company and interestingly quirky uses these ideas not just to solicit new concepts from the crowd but they use gamification to vet those concepts help with the design figure out the pricing determine the market strategy there's a lot going on it's an entire system and process and it's enabling the company to do something that no consumer products organization has ever been able to do quirky is on target to launch to new consumer products a month as an organization imagine two new consumer products a month being launched by any of our major organizations this is a sea change in creativity and innovation and it's gamification that leads the way now what are some of the structural things that enable gamification to accomplish this sort of miracle with creativity and one of them is something that quirky understands really well and that's the idea of constraint so this is really important it turns out that constraint is very important for driving creativity in the past we thought that it was something like you know you're not having any money you needing to be creative to survive but there's other elements of constraint that enable that think about this everyone in the developed world has in their pocket a device like this one that's capable of recording a high-definition film editing it putting a score on it and uploading it to the Internet and every year to YouTube people upload the equivalent of eight million full-length feature films worth of content to YouTube every year so now tell me shouldn't the statistics have proven that already on YouTube we should have had a raging bull or the other Dream Team some kind of amazing movie that would have come out of the YouTube era we've got lots of great content on YouTube but we haven't managed to produce things of that quality from this context and it's because it's not just about access to the tools in order to drive creativity it's got to have some amount of constraint and that's something that IBM understands very well in its design for its game a fight system called cityone this is basically a SimCity for people who run cities so if you're actually involved in the management of a city you can go on IBM's website and play this game it's Sin City for you called city 1 and already today tens of millions of people around the world have benefited from the lessons that city managers have learned by playing city 1 change the variables in the city see what happens figure out can we do more trash delivery do we need more water supply fascinating right now one of the things that city 1 highlights critically about the nature of gamification its ability to drive creativity is the idea of easy failure enabling people to fail easily because after all in a game-like context how does failure work right your character dies you get run over by something you fall off a cliff you click a button you start again no penalty right would you get to fail and keep doing it over and over and over again and learning through failure is very powerful but consider is our education system are our jobs structured in such a way to enable this learning from failure we all say that learning from failure is great but schools and workplaces are pretty high pressure do you know the answer to that question oh that was wrong that's terrible everybody notices the mistake that you made no matter how coddled you think our children are the reality is they still live in a fairly high pressure environment of testing and questioning them in public we don't make failure as easy as it needs to be whereas in the game of fight environment we do now why we care about that the third leg of how gamification drives innovation is the concept of perseverance or grit perseverance is our ability to push through difficult obstacles when we want to accomplish something to get through the crap so to speak to get to the amazing other side and perseverance is the number one predictor of success for somebody's creative endeavors and their career and if you put it together with something like great fluid intelligence you have the sort of magical combination that we need to be able to get through and solve some of the world's biggest problems now gamification enables us to drive perseverance that failure loop I talked about it teaches you the player that failure is okay and you need to keep pushing through when your character dies when you can't pass this level when you can't accomplish something you just keep going you start again and you keep going and you keep going and you keep going and we drive that over and over now it wasn't always this way in the game space back when games took quarters games like Donkey Kong for example were designed to fail you on the first level they were really hard because the designers wanted you to put as many quarters as possible into the machine now that the economics of gamification are about keeping you in the game for as long as possible the equations totally changed and it's teaching people how to persevere and how to push through but sometimes pure perseverance isn't enough we need kids to learn new skills and new talents and some things especially more difficult challenges require people to learn tools which sometimes can be kind of complicated or difficult and so one company that sort of understands this that sees this AI idea is a company called Autodesk they make 3d modeling software and every time a 3d movie comes out millions of people go to Autodesk's website and think I want to do 3d modeling I love that movie and they download this software from Autodesk and then what they find out is that 3d modeling is actually really hard like it's not easy to do and that's why we don't all do 3d modeling for a living so Autodesk recognizing that this was the case realize that they have to get into the business of teaching people how to use the tool so they put a gamification structure around their application so when you download it you are a secret agent on a mission it's a lot like where in the world is Carmen Sandiego if you guys remember that game that was one of my favorites you travel around the world solving these problems you've given a puzzle you're given some clues and in order to unlock each clue as you travel around the world you have to learn a basic element of 3d modelling like make the object all rotate the object light the object set it on fire bounce it around and in the end you look up and you go oh my god I learned how to be a 3d modeler through the prism of games now let me give you some stats just to give you a sense of what I'm talking about through this gamification framework Autodesk increase the amount of time that people use their 3d modeling software by 40% for 0 and increase the total sales of their software by 17% as a result of this imagine if we could apply if we could get kids to do 40% more STEM education science technology engineering and math imagine if we could get them 17% more people to choose careers in that field how amazing that would be and that's part of helping people find what they're good at the gamification facilitates and the last element that drives creativity and gamification is about speed and pressure it turns out that actually putting some pressure on people can help them make better decisions and feel better about themselves pairen and Jacobs for example doing this famous research that fast decisions make people feel happier and we now have a bunch of research a body of evidence that suggests that certain kinds of decisions are actually better made when they're made quickly and a whole thread of gamification examples like blitz and like gamestorming that use the power of speed and pressure to get people to make more decisions and to make them more quickly and through the power of the crowd vet those decisions and find the best ones now many of the examples that I've given you sound awesome if we're dealing with you know ten-year-old kids and like a new concept and what about in the real world Gabe what about the real-world use of gamification and innovation and so I'll give you the most extreme example that I can of how this can work in the real world the Department of Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom it is the governmental department responsible for unemployment insurance and Retraining people it alone accounts for 30% of the UK's total overall governmental spending this one Department of the government it's got hundreds of thousands of employees it reaches all parts of the UK it is a very entrenched bureaucracy it is not known for being innovative that is not its middle name but they decided that they wanted to act innovation power of the community of people who work at the DWP and say we launched a pretty cool idea called idea Street and the concept of idea Street is pretty simple anyone in the company can propose a new concept for the DWP to do and that concept becomes a stock in a virtual stock market so your ideas get bought and sold by your co-workers and your colleagues and your peers using virtual currency and the best results quickly bubble to the top they're the ones that are most valuable in the stock market and then the company comes through the organization comes through and redeems them by buying them off the market in the first 90 days the DWP generated 1,500 new ideas and a potential for 90 million pounds worth of savings in the organization just by using that game of fied example so I'd posit fundamentally that we've entered into this new era debt gamification when applied correctly can help us drive unmet untold creativity a new kind of creativity one that's pretty different from the creativity we thought of before but adds all of those ideas together that's about education that's about access that's about being prolific it's about new methodology and it's also about being commercially successful that all of those things kind of put together are embodied in this new sort of creativity and that with the social layer with the elements of connectedness that gamification allows and some of the different frameworks that we talked about today the three apps feedback friends and fun the winners effect that kind of dopamine loop and also things like constraint like the ability to fail like speed and pressure like perseverance these things together pretend an entirely new opportunity for creativity a change in the way that we think and potentially the best hope for our future imagine if we took our kids back to the medieval era imagine if you could take any of today's kids 10 year-olds like Griffin for example back to the medieval era what would our ancestors have thought of them they would seem like magical geniuses right appearing from the future capable of manipulating technology understanding things in the world that people in that era never would have understood we often like to make fun of kids today and say they're kind of dumb right Tim finish them because they're so technologically connected because they play so many games because they have a different kind of socializing from the way that we grew up because we see them as not being able to focus or have attention but in fact I posit maybe they are geniuses maybe this is the new creativity and if the power of gamification allows us to unleash their collective ability we'll all win thank you

## [Gamification: Learning the Fun Way | Geetanjali Vinod | TEDxElproIntlSchool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvh50uG2Gok)
when i was in second grade our school started a token system so basically you behaved well answered all the questions and kept your bench neat and you would get plastic coins with various colors and numbers that looked something like this once a term we got to use those coins to buy toys and stationery our formerly unruly class was now the most perfect little angels in fact within three months we had been so good that we had actually earned more token points than coins in circulation our teacher had to start marking the points down on a chart and the physical coins were removed i remember the first time i ever learned to bake a cake it was with my first grade teacher together the class made three cakes even after six years i still remember every detail of it at a glance you could say hey what's this teacher doing she ought to be teaching kids maths but in reality the teachers had cleverly managed to teach us a lot calculations measurements and more and at the end of that hard work we all got the reward of a delicious slice of cake it was amazing and most of the students performed well in the next maths test these were examples of gamification so what exactly is gamification it means to incorporate game elements like rewards scores points etc into something like teaching what i'm trying to say is that using this tool gamification we can help students learn in a better way gamification has been around for nearly a century but in terms of education i believe that it hasn't been used to its complete potential so i'm sure that nearly everyone can relate to that tired bored feeling when facts are just being relayed to you i know i felt the same the problems not really about the actual things that are taught but more about the way that it's presented to students picture this you're a teacher in a classroom about to teach history if you started by saying we will be studying world war ii please turn your books to page 74. i guarantee you half your class would be daydreaming by the time you finish most likely you won't be able to captivate your students or get them really interested in the topic but think how their reaction would be if you said it was first september 1939 troops from various countries were to be rallied in preparation for the oncoming world war ii using another sub element of gamification storytelling you can grab people's attention gamification allows children to have a fun and interactive education using this tool we will be able to help students to understand concepts and later solve real-world problems by changing our current schooling system in this way we might be able to help everyone everyone retain this knowledge throughout life for example i always love learning history and it's really exciting to me i know for a fact that my friends don't necessarily share the same views some of them have confessed that they think it's a drag well maybe that's because the way of teaching needs to be changed i remember my friends being reluctant to start a conversation on the topic but once i described it like an epic war with protagonists and antagonists they were really absorbed so why why is gamification that important anyway have you ever noticed that any char becomes a breeze when we're having fun while doing it in one of my favorite books the adventures of tom sawyer tom makes the uber boring task of whitewashing events really exciting he even got his friends to view things in favor of this argument in the same way we can make learning a fun and fascinating adventure for everyone one thing i've noticed is that when people are actually enjoying the subject at hand it lets them see things in a different light it gives us a new perspective on things games and practicals like projects and experiments are really important and i'm sure everyone wants to have a good time in school why can't learning become an awesome adventure it makes learning so much better like adding sugar to an ice cream mix you won't enjoy it if it just if it just tasted like frozen cream right in the same way a spoonful of games can go a long way another thing that i consider is essential for the betterment of the schooling system is in interactive learning in the past most people would consider teaching as a one-way transfer of information with the teachers speaking and the students being recipients of new knowledge but a new in fact a 21st century version would be one where both the students and the teachers take equal part in an exchange of information and ideas in my class we always share new facts or the current news with each other and with our teacher adding inputs too we start a class conversation it was really fun and we got to hear news from around the world whether it was politics or a meteor shower we kept discussing various topics this kept us regularly informed about what was going on in the world around us we all tend to drift off sometimes when we find the subject boring and especially when we feel that there is nothing we can do with all that new knowledge in subjects like science and i.t because we can actually experiment with things a lot of people find it more interesting if only there was a way to make other subjects like say maths and social studies more interesting for every student with this two-way interaction we can form a collaboration between students and teachers to learn a lesson we also impo we also learn the important skill of thinking outside the box instead of being restrained in the boundaries of a curriculum why not share in the diversity and cultures from around the world or maybe discussing current affairs can help in understanding both sides of a scenario rapid round quizzes were another thing that we did as a class and i believe it brought us a lot closer it certainly broadened our horizons the use of ar vr and mr in our classrooms is an advanced form of gamifying learning with this tech we could bring forth a whole new world of possibilities what if you could experience history blast off into outer space dive into the deepest oceans all while standing in your classrooms teachers could take the students to various locations around the world or even see an atom spinning and apps are another form of gamifying learning which is incredibly far-reaching now anyone with an internet connection and a device can have access to good quality education and contact teachers people anywhere in the world can learn the subjects they want to without even having to leave their homes we students we never missed a year of our schooling thanks to a couple of apps now one thing to understand is that every student is different they have different needs and unique unique abilities they all need individualized assistance to help improve their weak spots in a class of children sometimes their individual requirements would be overlooked but now with an individualized form of learning they will be able to excel with the extra help the use of flash cards pictures and charts also helps us to understand this is because up to 90 percent of the data processed by your brain is visual gamification has so many benefits like firstly it stays in a person's memory for longer certain studies show that seeing visuals while learning can help improve your memory of a subject by up to four hundred percent secondly complex concepts can be explained in an easy way can you imagine for me in your head a purple colored plane figure with four equal straight sides and four right angles yeah it's a purple square but did figuring out what i was talking about confused you for a second what if i wanted you to understand what a purple square was but instead of saying all that stuff i just showed you this picture right away you can understand everything that i just mentioned without all the confusion thirdly games let us experience things first hand for instance a play on a historical figure or maybe a treasure hunt to find the material that will conduct electricity additionally a collaboration-style education helps kids with their social skills kids learn the importance of working together take it from me it's not always easy when you group with new people sometimes those whom you've never met before but at the end of it every group member works in unison to achieve their one goal i have a lot of friends who without these projects i would never have even talked to once i cannot stress how vital it is for people to learn how to cooperate with one another these people may no longer be in my class some of them not even in my school anymore but those few months that we spent researching brainstorming and occasionally arguing and fighting made us friends for life it's play that helps us to do serious things better games add to the educational experience and helps improve learning by making it more purposeful to face the oncoming challenges of our nation and of the world we need young people with creative thoughts and ignited minds like dr apj abdul kalam said when learning is purposeful creativity blossoms when creativity blossoms thinking emanates and when thinking emanates knowledge is fully lit thank you

## [The Power of Gamification in Education | Scott Hebert | TEDxUAlberta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOssYTimQwM)
I'm here to talk about education I've been a teacher since 2009 I would ask you really simply if education was an investable tradable commodity would you be interested in investing in it when we think about education and we think about investment they don't go hand in hand when you want to invest in something you want something that's fluid something that's dynamic something it's gonna be changing adapting with the times and then you get education which may be the most static stagnant thing that exists that is accepted if I bought a computer from Apple if I brought a computer from any computer company and they told me you can buy stock in my company but I'll never change the product I would immediately turn around and walk away but in education we love that and that is the the problem and I've had as a teacher since I entered the profession now people argue with me all the time they say well of course education is change and I'd say yes it's changed superficially the same exact way this girl is the exact same person she is underneath her sit underneath these copious layers of makeup she's not changing herself at the core and that's what I'm talking about in a change in education can you change education at the core get away from grades get away from all these ridiculous standards and expectations and realize that we are dealing with a population that is there to gain knowledge from us in a space that should be free of judgment we should be able to construct them criticisms give them constructive criticism without them being fearful of taking risk now education doesn't always look this way this is me waiting for kindergarten my first day of kindergarten I apparently waited for like I believe my mom told me 22 minutes at the end of this driveway why because waste school was supposed to be when I was a young lad in this chair here at four or five years old was exactly what I saw on Sesame Street and Barney and all these shows I watched on TV supposed to be fun dynamic engaging playing with friends I should be digging in sand boxes to learn about things not reading and writing are not writing about them worksheets and education started as a absolutely incredible place for me now again god bless my mom when I moved from Ontario tell Berta she scrapbook my life which is awesome I always bring this in for throwback Thursdays at school at school and I like kids look but the beautiful part about this is this is every school photo I've ever had taken of me and check out what happens between grade five and six so why stop smiling it's where my education experience goes down the proverbial toilet and it does this because it's one play and fun and discovery based learning is eliminated in favor of worksheets and straight rows and silence and order and regime last I checked very few workplaces like that as a matter of fact I don't think any speaker that was on this stage today talked about being orderly being following direction and on all these things they talked about being creative and innovative and I don't think school does that so I quoted myself because why not and I realized after a few years of quote-unquote research and I'll get to how I did that in a second I realized that the education system is a system that is totally in an engagement crisis we blame the kids and we blame lack of resources and we blame all these things when in reality these kids are bored and what do we do when we're bored the same thing you point be doing right now if you're bored of me you are looking at your phone you are counting the amount of lights on the ceiling you are determining if your shoelaces are tied perfectly you are doing everything to entertain yourself when you are bored in a situation and that is what I think school is for kids now like any good educator I ask myself what would Bill Murray do and Bill Murray of course would tell me to make a difference why do I use Bill Murray when Bill Murray was stuck in Groundhog Day arguably his best film he turned around and he said okay I finally realized what the issue is I'm a jerk to everybody and I need to fix being a jerk in order to advance out of this problem and he does and everyone's happy and he learns a life lesson that's exactly what needs to happen in education we have to realize that education to kids is ground all day every single day so I said yes Bill Murray I will I will make a difference so here's my research you have to understand something as an educator I can tell you that the single biggest untapped resource in education are the students we will ask every single person what they need except them and they'll tell you so I sat down with them and I said all right what do you guys dislike about school because I was fortunate enough to start my career in kindergarten to grade for phys ed where you saw kids loving school they were so fired up about school they'd come off the bus they tell me about everything that they did that day even though I had no clue what they were talking about but they were excited then I had a career change and I ended up in a grade eight science class massively different totally different set of hormones were dealing with in grade eight and all of a sudden I had kids who couldn't care about anything I was talking about and the kids that care didn't care for the right reason they cared because they're often scared about their parents being just disappointed about the grades so I said well do I really want to do this for the next 20-some years of my career add to the cycle I think is broken so I talked to the kids and I got three common trends first thing I got is kids told me flat out school is boring it is repetitive it is the same thing every class I go to except instead of science I get math instead of math I get social and they go forward and forward and forward with this continuously now I learned to check my ego at the door as a teacher pretty quickly and what I actually heard when I wasn't angry and I wasn't like oh what do you mean my class was boring I they said give me a reason to care about this stuff because at 13 why the heck do I have to know what a mitochondria is I don't even know how to spell mitochondria and I even I don't even know how I got to this classroom all I know is that if I look at my phone and I go to kids then my tongue will pop out like a dog and that's way more important to me than vents then biology so I was like okay that's totally logical I've been 13 I wasn't too interested in that content so I come across in Brittany Brown came up a lot today like just read her stuff she is so phenomenal and she says you know what if we want to reignite passion we have to humanize work and you could literally just cross out work in this code and pop in school you have to make kids believe that they are doing something for a reason for a purpose second common thing I got is kids feel like they have no choice in anything all the time and I don't disagree with that at all I hear it and I've lived it this is the project you have to do with these stipulations and this rubric is how its marked and that's all you get and all of a sudden the kid who's like got this wicked idea gets buried and it falls to the copy-paste I used to drive me nuts as a teacher the first year I taught this every project was the same why cuz they googled the project and whatever the first hit was was what the project was even if they had no idea what it was they literally were like I don't even know what this is but here it is that's what you wanted and it fits every criteria the rubric so sucker you got to give me a hundred percent and I'm like to all men that's again good logic so I said what are they actually saying they're saying trust me because I have a brain in between these ears and I can do something and that's backed entirely Daniel H pink who is a TED talk ER and a business leader talks about how control leads the compliance however autonomy leads to engagement so I said okay I got these ideas now now they're starting to drive around on my head and the third one and this is my favorite because I'm all about passion and that's what this stage is for why can't I do things in the way that I want to do them which exactly from a teacher's perspective says can you just let me be creative for a second can you let me take this rubric that I don't like and shred it and just I'll you want me to build this I'll build it but I want to use my stipulations and my parameters and I want to inject music cause I'm passionate about music no problem and that again is totally backed and this is being forecasted as a huge problem in education at the World Economic Forum in February and I'm gonna say this name hopefully good me news Shafiq who is the head of the London School of Economics as well as John MA I think it's John mauve not mistaken who is the richest man in Asia founder of Alibaba is warning the world that the projection by 2030 is an elimination of 800 million jobs due to autumn ization because he said and I love this quote as a teacher if a robot can do it better than a person someone's gonna pick a robot over a human and what a school do school says here's everything I just told you got it write it on a paper good you're smart but in reality the kids often have no concept what they're writing because I didn't go deeper so I said all right what am I gonna do about this autonomy engagement engagement crisis no control no choice all these problems and I said well let's go back to our absolute founding roots I'm a physique meter as my degree so plate is so fundamental to me and it's so important to me so I looked around and I said okay did some googling and I came across this concept in 2015 very in its infancy and education called gamification and what is it it literally means take the principles of game design and plunk them in an area where there's no game like school matter of fact school is probably the most anti game thing you can have we are however totally victimized by gamification on a daily basis how many of you by Tim Hortons coffee right now specifically because roll up the rim I do my coffee consumption goes up a hundred times because I just want to roll up and get another subpar coffee but there's nothing more I can do about that how many of us have a credit card where you go around and on that credit card you had a choice between a regular one or a points one and then you get a points credit card and you're like I'm totally screwing the system all these purchases are getting me points then you're like sweet I got 72,000 points what am I gonna get a toaster awesome this is a seventy two thousand dollar toaster so now we have problems and issues with this so I said okay I'm gonna do it but now the problem I got when I talked about gamification in its early infancy was people said gamers big slobby people live in their basement and I'm like oh seriously we still talk about this no this guy is actually hyper dedicated to what he does and if I could get kids this dedicated about science I'm totally doing my job the second thing is that games are just absolutely littered littered with creativity-wise minecraft so popular in terms of the actual gaming community it is simply because it is a sandbox game if you want don't want to no one has to tell you anything they're literally just like here's some blocks and put them on other blocks and holy cow why are you playing this for 14 hours but they will why because someone will come to this castle and go oh my god dude that's amazing and you're like it is amazing I am awesome and I'm gonna go ahead and build more things and they just get absolutely stuck in the fact that they are doing something a hundred percent at their choice and let's just not forget this there's nothing wrong with play and fun so many times I meet parents who are like well when you were playing I mean how can you be learning and I'm like so you're calling play the antithesis of fun and they're like if that means what I said then yes and I'm like okay so you're telling me then that when when we play we learn nothing it is a hundred percent a waste of time and energy no point proven animals play to teach themselves things like you know hunting skills and survival skills and all that we play for entertainment but there's also these quick things that we gain with like reaction speeds and all these kinds of different things that actually can come through games so I said okay I'm going to do it so in 2015 I Unleashed something called the fight for scientist arrow which is nothing more than the fight for science land but it sounds way cooler in Latin so I went about it and I stripped my classroom bare and I said I am gonna find out what's actually valuable to you do you need desks do you need chairs to learn or is that something that teachers think you need so they build their furniture in my room that teaches stem learning something that I couldn't get through they do practical application of all of their knowledge continuously we build things to help people to save people we battle monsters in trivia contests we go through through say us helping younger children you come across in this game by delivering lessons to them that they memorize to then go help their own communities and yacht and the whole concept is wrapped around eliminating rote memorization because rote memorization is useless this device that we all carry in our pocket will do anything and everything I need it to do at the moment I needed so why would I say hey while you write this test you don't get to use that but when you start your career you get to use that it's completely hypocritical so I decided to just use it all the time so I thought I was a genius I was like man this is awesome Gosling's gonna tweet me hey Scott you know let's get some coffee you're doing fantastic work but in reality I got a lot of backlash the reason I got a lot of backlash it's because I realized three things when you want to innovate you want to create and you want to change we are a fearful of change especially in education here's why if my parents learned in desks and their parents learned in desks and rows and quiet regime well I'm screwing up the future if they are not in desks because look at all the cool stuff we've done our society with desks and I go whoa wait a second if you read a lot of the research or a lot of the quotes about people they were anti desk and a lot of them didn't even finish high school and use their own creative processes to develop the things that are so famous today the second thing I realized we don't like failure however at every teaching conference and convention I go they bring up some researcher who says we need to fail and then we're like okay sure what's the best practice I don't know but that's something we should definitely be doing and I say okay so we're cool with like Pinterest fails these are viral right here's the thing we tried it but when it comes to a classroom I saw how resistive teachers were about failing in front of their kids and I'm like but wait a second you want them to fail but you don't ever so I will purposely teach lessons and experiments that screw up and then have kids pick apart why it went wrong and pretend like I had no clue unless they watch this and now they're in on it but I will do these things to show them that I want them to take risks now this again is probably the quote I live by I was fortunate enough last year to go from convention to Global News to the front page of the Edmonton Journal to making the front page of Reddit with this approach to where I started getting really awesome keyboard warrior comments about how was ruining the future pandering to kids good releasing another generation of snowflakes whatever that even means and I real and this was hard for me I was like man I'm really trying so hard to do good for kids I just wanted to care about school I don't care about grades and all that I mean let's let's be honest here let's go back to the incredible talk by Shelby grades in grade 8 are about as useless as bringing a bikini armor to a sword fight they mean nothing the only time grades matters when they go to university and that's like you know sometimes you do at the tail end of grade 10 11 and 12 my grade a kid wears as a badge that tells him or her if they are good at said subject and my job is to make sure that number can be as high as possible so that they believe that they are good at that subject and they might invite future passions and innovations and creativity instead subject but if my goal is I don't care about you you're just a number on a paper and I'm just going to push you through the system boom boom boom then I'm not doing my job kids need to know that in the arena of Education I am not on the outside clapping for them they need to know that I'm in the arena fighting alongside them picking them up when they fall down brushing them off and saying it is okay because that is what is going to create the future innovators that we so badly need with all the crazy problems that the current situations we are in global warming problems with food and water and all these different kinds of things we need crazy wild innovative thinking not someone who can say the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell I'm gonna write that down and I'm gonna pretend that I'm good at biology that's what school is so back to this quote I got lamb basted by people and I took really really took it to heart till I realize I don't need to be a jackass whisperer I do not need to tell people who think it's stupid why it's not I need those kids in my classroom to believe in what we and believe in themselves and each other and we're gonna be fine so really it's up to you in whatever facet of work that you have whether it is business whether it is you know engineering since that's a whole bunch of things we had about today about engineering we've come a lot about innovation and it is your job to take that risk I love the news talking about stepping off that carpet take that risk and see what comes out of it and listen to the people you work with and work for because they will tell you now I love this quote I want you to think in your mind when this was said if we teach today as we talk tomorrow ours we taught yesterday we robbed students of tomorrow this was set in 1917 that is a hundred and one years old this year that this quote was said 101 years ago we identified the education system needed to change 101 years later Here I am talking about it and I better not be here 101 years from now which would be cool talking about it again thank you 

## [Gamification to improve our world: Yu-kai Chou at TEDxLausanne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Qjuegtiyc)
imagine a world where labor is obsolete where work is something of the past but miraculously everything's still functioning better than ever before no I'm not talking about a society run by robots I'm talking about a world harnessing the power of play and I believe that there's a lot we can learn from games to make that world happen so today I'm going to talk to you about how gamification can make our world a better place so let's start with games who plays games most of the people when they think of a gamer I think about people like these little kids and guys who probably single probably unemployed and eat pizza onto their shirts but the actual statistics could be very surprising to many the average gamer is actually 35 years old almost 70% of them are over 18 about half of them are women which means there's actually more adult woman playing games than male under 18 if you consider social mobile games like candy crush or Angry Birds so what does this mean this means that everyone can be a gamer this is a very generic demographic this could be your clients could be your employees could be your children could be your parents everyone has the capacity to enjoy games if there's a good reason to do so so what is gamification gamification is the craft to take all those fun exciting elements of games and pouring them into boring non-game contexts things you have to do but you don't necessarily want to do so when I say gamification some of you might start thinking about what we call the PBL's the points badges and leaderboards and this is where a lot of people think oh if I just take points and put into a product or badges it'll make it fun and exciting and that's a big misconception when I started in gamification in 2003 it was a very lonely passion for me very few people cared about it and very few people understood it now about three four years ago gamification became a buzzword and a lot more people and companies organizations schools started to care about it but still very few people truly understand it so if you think about what makes a game fun if you ask gamers that they're not going to say oh because the game has points they'll say oh because it challenges me and makes me use my creativity allows me to hang with friends it makes me be more than who I am today and if you think about it every single game out there has game elements and game mechanics in them but most games are still boring most games are still not engaging so it's very naive to think that oh if I just take these game elements mechanics from that you can find in games that are even boring and pour them into products and experiences it'll automatically make it super fun and exciting so what we know here is that good gamification does not start with game elements but really starts with how it motivates our core drives so I spent many years developing a gamification framework called och Tallis's and it's a design framework based on an octagon shape and in the center of our taluses are eight core drives I believe these are eight core drives that motivates motivate us to do everything that we do in games out of games so I'm going to go through these eight core drives and show you one example about sighs how something amazing out there changes the world with it the first core drive is epic meaning and calling this is the core drive that says you're motivated because you feel like you're part of something bigger than yourself so in a game it does that often the world's about to end and for some reason you're the only person qualified to save the world you feel big but there's a lot of other examples to make people feel bigger than there are it can be used to get children with cancer in Children's Hospital to update their pain journals and that's what pain squad does so pain squad is an app that gets kids to record their pain journal so doctor can diagnose them better and you can imagine if you're a child and you have cancer you feel lonely you feel like no one cares about you you're in pain you're not very motivated to keep keep track of your pain Journal so the paint squad is AB that tends that you're in the secret police force dedicated to hunt down the stinkle pain and the moto is keep pain in its place whenever there's pain two times a day you got to record it down but to reinforce on that epic minion calling look what they do in the app hey okay welcome to pain squad it's really great you're here we need all the help we can get to help with pain in its you are now officially a full-fledged detective in pain squad well done at this rate you know I didn't get the next chief they just don't make them like you anymore you truly are one of pain spots best and brightest keep it up but this case isn't closed yet your squad is still fighting we couldn't have done it without you it's a way to go so now when the child updates her pain journal she's not just doing something because she has to she feels like she's part of something important a team depends on her she's fighting with the team against this force called pain and that motivates her that's epic meaning and calling the second core drive is development and accomplishment and this is the core drive that says you're motivated because you feel like you're improving you're leveling up you're achieving mastery and one of the most well known examples of this core Drive is the Nike Plus Nike FuelBand so we all know that health and exercise is very important but it's a health as a long-term thing and our brains are terrible at processing long term benefits we like short-term gratifications so what the Nike+ does really well is it shows you short-term accomplishments it shows you how hey you have run an extra mile compared to last week you're improving your Nikes plus score is getting higher and so you feel accomplished you feel I'm growing I'm getting better and leveling up and that motivates you and to further drive that feeling of accomplishment and also to introduce the character to celebrate with you whenever you hit a new milestone this little character jumps up and down so excited so happy falls on its face and is like yeah 10,000 Nike few points earned you feel accomplished the third core drive is empowerment of creativity and feedback so that's kind of like Lego you give users the basic building blocks and there's an infinite amount of ways for you to utilize your creativity to try a different combination strategy see feedback and adjust and that's a very engaging process so my favorite example in core dr3 is the serious game called folded so scientists have been trying to figure out this AIDS virus protein structure problem and the top PhDs in the world couldn't figure this out for 15 years so they decided to make a game called Foldit and as you can see you have a big protein there's things you can do with it you have an objective such as maximizing surface space and miraculously this problem that no one could solve was sold by a gamer in ten days so when you think about how a 15 year old problem is sold in ten dates through a game you have to see how powerful games can be in making our world a better place the fourth core drive is ownership and possession this is the core drive that says because you feel like you own something you want to improve it you want to protect it and you want to get more so this is the core drive that powers a lot of virtual goods virtual currency things like that it's also the core drive that motivate us to accumulate wealth but it can also get us to learn math dragonbox is a learning game that gets little kids between five to nine year olds to be obsessed with solving hundreds of middle school algebra questions now I don't know about you but when I was a kid math was the ultimate school grind like everything else could be fun you know physics can be fun science history can be fun but math now math is not fun math you just sit there and you have to do it so your parents don't get mad at you so let's check out how dragonbox gets this to be fun for little kids so the premise of the game is that you have a box and inside the box there's a baby dragon this baby dragon only wants to come out when nothing's around it so it can eat so this is the onboarding state teaching the rules these green circles you see are zeros in disguise zero means nothing so you tap on it disappears zero means nothing it scans the dragon wants to come out and eat happy now on stage three it introduced some basic math principles positive robot and negative robot cancel each other out become zero negative two and positive two cancel each other out become zero and now the dragon scans and the dragon wants to come out eat again and you can see the little dragon turns from the egg to a little baby nice and one at one point it gets pretty complex the dragon box becomes a X and you're trying to isolate that eggs so you have C you have to do things like balance both sides of the equation multiply everything by two you also need to make sure the numbers are optimally solved so no 2 over 4 so you can see it this process the child is trying to make sure something this is optimally solved and the dragon will eat it because it's yummy but the other two they're not so dragon refuses to eat it that those will be yuck as you can see it be young yeah yeah you know bad numbers dragons don't like bad numbers so the child only gets one star out of three so now the child doesn't even know his doing math he's just trying to feed his dragon girls dragons like Oh huh why don't I get three stars I got to figure out a better way to isolate this so the dragon wants to eat everything something really really amazing the fifth core drive of autologous is social influence and relatedness this is pretty straightforward this is basically what you do based on what other people think do your say and my favorite example here is Opower Opower is a utility SAS company that tries to get people to lower their utility bills and they saw that the best way to change people's behavior is to show them how their neighbors are doing you show them their utility how much you're using your best neighbor and your average neighbor and everyone who always thinks they're somewhat a little above average which is impossible if you can't have everyone above average when they see that oh I need to change my behavior so with Opower within a year they saved over 250 million dollars of utility bills and that's a lot of electricity over one territory terawatt the sixth core drive of octal Isis and scarcity and impatience so this is a core drive that says you want something just because you can't have it like if grapes are on the table you really don't care about the grapes but if they're on a shelf just beyond your reach you're always think about those grapes you know can I have them when can I have them are these even sweet and Kickstarter is a great example that utilize a lot of great game design techniques they first dangle this great reward this great prize in front of your cool technology then they show you what we call a countdown timer 21 days to go you have to act now if you don't act now you won't get this prize so the sense of urgency then it shows you what will the last mile drive oh there's only $3,000 left the only 2000 more and we'll get it you'll get it and finally it's all together this what we call a group quests you can only get you can only accomplish the quest when entire team will move sword together on it the seven core drive is unpredictability and curiosity this is the quadrant that says because you don't know what's going to happen next you're always thinking about it and this is the core drive that's heavily utilized in gambling industry but it's also the core drive that makes us want to finish a book or watch a movie and can also be used for a lot of other good things like getting people to obey the speed limit this is speak am lottery how it works is whenever you drive by the speak am lottery and you're speeding it will take a picture of your car and you'll give you a fine pretty straightforward but when you're going by this became lottery and you're within the speed limit it'll enter into a lottery pot where you can when you have a chance to win the money from those who are fine so even though it your chances of winning is fairly low and it's not a lot of money to begin with because everyone thinks that oh maybe I'll win this time maybe I'll win this time you try to change your behavior slow down ha you know so speak em lottery successfully reduces the speed of passing cars by twenty percent very tangible the eighth and final core drive is loss and avoidance and this is also straightforward it's your doing something to avoid a loss you don't want bad things to happen and my favorite example here is called zombies run now remember we in court drive t we talked about Nike+ motivating people to run to make them feel accomplished feel like they're growing feel like they're improving now zombies run makes people run because they don't want to be eaten by zombies so zombies run is a game that pretends you're in this apocalyptic world where zombies have taken over everything and you're this runner in the in the wilderness in the world of zombies and you're running with earphones on and there's a radio station with with with binoculars talking you say hey careful runner 5 there's a horde of zombies on the west Oh careful there's a zombie right behind you and he's gaining on you and then you hear south and you're like crap I got to run faster I don't be eaten right so again now you're eating because you don't know what you're running because you don't want to be eaten by zombies very strong motivation so these are the eight core drives ah calluses and like I said I believe every single thing you do is based on one or more of these core drives but it's also put together on an octagon shape for a reason the left side core drives are more extrinsic motivation core drives which means you're doing these things for a goal for a purpose for a reward the ones on the right are the intrinsic motivation core drives which means you're doing it because it's just enjoyable you don't need a reward to use your creativity you don't need a reward to hang with friends and you don't necessarily need to gain anything by being in the suspense of unpredictability in fact most people have fun losing money in casinos and if you notice the core drives on the top are more positive I call them white hat gamification techniques so if you're always doing something because you feel like you're being something part of being part of something bigger than yourself and you're growing you're improving and using your creativity it feels very very good it feels like you're in control you're powerful the ones on the bottom I call them black hat game techniques and if you're always doing something just because you want to avoid a loss just because you don't know what's gonna happen next or you can't have something it's going to be very very powerful motivation but sometimes in the long run leaves a bad taste to your mouth and it's not a very sustainable long-term design so once you have that framework you can start analyzing why different things are engaging and motivate you can look at Facebook how it's how it motivates us and maybe last a little bit an epic minion calling maybe a little bit of scarcity you know you can there's it basically everything you want you can get on Facebook you can look at things like LinkedIn right in LinkedIn yeah there's not a lot of space to utilize your creativity I'm like you create a profile you look at people that's about it but it is relatively important there's ownership it's your own life there's a lot of things in LinkedIn that's that engages people so that's just level one autologous there's actually five levels in total and it gets a lot more complicated later on but the premise is this good gamification design is a complex subject it's not just slapping on points badges leaderboard game mechanics onto an experience it's never a cookie cutter Ellucian and so when I started in 2003 I had a vision I foresaw a world where there's no longer a divide between what you have to do and what you want to do and in this world all you have to do is play all day and everything you need to do is getting done you support your family you have better relationships your organizations perform better and society overall becomes more productive and I work every single day of my life to push towards that vision but there's only so much I can do by myself so that's why I need you to be part of that journey with me so that we create a world where whenever we wake up in the morning we'll say wow that dream was amazing but I'm so glad I woke up and back to reality because that's where the real fun is at thank you
