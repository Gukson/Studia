# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to this repository! Here are a few guidelines to follow:

1.  **Submit an issue before making any changes**. If you're thinking about making a change, it's best to submit an issue first to discuss the proposed change and ensure that it aligns with the goals of the repository.
    
2.  **Make changes in a fork**. Create a fork of the repository, make your changes, and then submit a pull request.
    
3.  **Don't make changes to `.gitignore` and `.obsidian`**. These files are used by the repository's maintainers to maintain the structure and organization of the notes. Changes to these files will not be accepted, except for automatic changes made by Obsidian or changes that have been discussed and covered before in issues.
    
4.  **Follow the same format and style**. Try to match the format and style of the existing notes as closely as possible.
    
5.  **Include explanations**. Make sure your changes are accompanied by explanations of what you did and why.
    
6.  **Test your changes**. Before submitting your changes, please test them to ensure they don't cause any errors or issues.
    
7.  **Be patient**. The repository maintainers will review your pull request as soon as possible, but please be patient if it takes a little longer.
